# DeepLearning_BasicCNN
This Repo shows the basic code for building a CNN layer from scratch, including basic code for convolution operation, kernels sliding windows, padding and pooling(downsampling). I trained on a two-class human face dataset using one layer CNN, with 8 kernels, and each kernel size is 3 by 3. The tuned model gives a good performance on test dataset.
